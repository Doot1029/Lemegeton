You can let the audience discover this slowly, perhaps through a shared appearance or a bizarrely similar life path.\r\n* The Reunion: When they meet, it shouldn't just be happy.

Eating enough of the apples will change them into a powerful God after death, however it would only take effect if this person has the key of apotheosis.\r\n\r\n## Features and Lore\r\n\r\n* Sanity Stat: Affects perception of the world. The world becomes more intense the less sanity you have. When lowered, Desdemona hallucinates, becomes more of a yandere/masogire, and becomes more delusional.\r\n* Wrath Stat: When higher, parts of a demon cannot be controlled, like in combat.\r\n* Loyalty Stat: When higher, demons are more loyal to Desdemona.\r\n* Scrawlings: A personal journal that gives you choices on what YOU want.\r\n* The Tree of Forbidden Knowledge (AKA the skill tree)\r\n* Goetiapon: A gacha mechanic to unlock goetia demons.\r\n* Scroll Chanting: To scroll chant, simply use the read command on a scroll, which will either give you a good outcome or a bad outcome, depending on the scroll's corresponding planet and what magic it does.

Following the Chaldean order will manifest things and cause events to happen in your favor, depending on the ruled planet.

However, if you mismatch the planetary hours from the planetary weekdays, it will not go as expected. For instance, Planetary hours are most frequent but have less magical potency, but planetary weekdays are most potent in magic but less frequent than the planetary hours. Combine this together, and you’ll have magic that is both frequent and magically potent. The player will need to type in their intent, also known as the influences each planet naturally has (from sigilcasting).\r\n* Sigilcasting Blood Magic: Sigilcasting is an action that requires a Dragonclaw and a Kamea Tablet. The Dragonclaw is used as a stylus to draw out sigils and to draw blood.

The tree signifies what lengths humans would go to achieve this meaning of life. It was said those who ate the apple will gain knowledge, but in this story it also said they would also become \"God-like\" after death.\r\n* Theurgic: A language created by Angels.\r\n* Goetic: A language created by demons.\r\n* The player can sleep to reset the day.

The first hour (1 AM) is the same hour of the planet’s day. To structure this idea in your mind, try and imagine this: The first hour (1 AM) of Saturday is saturn, the first hour of Sunday is the sun, the first hour of Monday is the moon, the first hour of Tuesday is mars, wednesday is mercury, thursday is jupiter, and lastly friday is venus. To fill in the blanks, you must follow the chaldean order, as the hours cycle continuously:\r\nSaturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon\r\n…Then back to Saturn. Rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nKing - Sun - Gold (Color: Gold)\r\nPrince - Jupiter - Tin (Color: Blue)\r\nDuke - Venus - Copper (Color: Green)\r\nEarl - Mars - Silver (Color: Red)\r\nMarquis - Moon - Silver (Color: Purple)\r\nKnight - Saturn - Lead (Color: Gray)\r\nPresident - Mercury - Mercury (Color: Orange)\r\n\r\nSun: Health, wealth, success, joy, luck, healing, leadership, vitality, creativity, and success. Use this hour for taking action, making decisions, and pursuing impactful projects.\r\nMoon: Psychic ability, spirituality, goddess energy, divination, emotions, intuition, reflection, and healing. Ideal for journaling, meditation, spending time with loved ones, and nurturing your inner self.\r\nMercury: Magic, knowledge, communication, writing, speech, communication, intellect, and learning. This hour is excellent for brainstorming, writing, planning, and engaging in intellectual pursuits.\r\nVenus: Love, friendship, relationship, compassion, the arts, beauty, harmony, and pleasure. Use this hour for romance, artistic endeavors, self-care, and creating a beautiful atmosphere.\r\nMars: Strength, vitality, health, sex, anger, action, energy, passion, and courage. This is a good time for tackling challenging tasks, pursuing your passions, and initiating new projects.\r\nJupiter: Luck, expansion, prosperity, money, empire, abundance, and wisdom. Use this hour for making financial plans, seeking opportunities, and connecting with mentors.\r\nSaturn: Work, stability, attention, reversals, impeding, stopping, discipline, structure, responsibility, and long-term goals. This hour is suitable for building foundations, focusing on practicality, and setting boundaries.\r\n\r\n24-hour daily cycle (12 daylight + 12 nighttime hours)\r\nEach weekday starts with its
