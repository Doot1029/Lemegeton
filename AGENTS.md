# Info about LoreJS

* Read everything in the folder called "ai-context"
* Code in "lemegeton.js"
* Use the command: "node index.js" to test the game
* Find '.../ai-context/images/...'to look for any screenshot images to read
* After reading an image, fix any issues that come up from reading the image and test the game again.
* Do this until the screenshot appears as it should be.
* Give me some brief commit message ideas.

NOTE: Deleting the screenshot images is not required, since it will overwrite anyway. Just make sure to keep using that command in order to read the screenshot images.
