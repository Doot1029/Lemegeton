## Title: Lemegeton

Genre: Religious/Supernatural, RPG, Gothic Horror
Audience: 17+
Lore: To follow the path of Godhood, Solomonis must learn the forbidden knowledge, train spirits, fight against other spirits with his familiar demons, find hidden artifacts, all while maintaining his reputation as a biblical king, as the story goes. In Eden, King Solomonis in Clavicula forces humans and spirits alike to attend the annual battle of Apotheosis Armageddon, a battle where the main trophy is becoming a God, called the Zenith Rank. Every night, there are many demons who lurk around Clavicula to steal souls, kill and terrorize the townspeople. The Grand Creator (God) isn't doing anything to stop it, because people don't believe in them anymore on Earth. The Grand Creator is dying due to a loss of faith, because of a dictator (Lucifer) is ruling Earth and Eden. Then, there came a birth of twins: Deo and Dominique. They both lived in a cottage with their loving religious mother. The twins were separated as kids due to Dominique getting kidnapped by King Solomonis into his cult after being hypnotized, possessing her to wander off into the woods. Solomonis, hearing the screams of Dominique's mother, smiles and names the child "Desdemona" to mock her mother before killing her.

Deo had known of Desdemona's disappearance, and took a long time figuring out where she had gone. Afraid she had died from getting kidnapped but in denial that she could be dead, Deo tries to find meaning in this. He figures that his twin sister was kidnapped by the cult, and instantly became enemies with the cult. Desdemona was manipulated and brainwashed by the cult, and she said she was destined to become the anti-christ, which wasn't far from the truth. Everytime she disobeyed, she was thrown into the basement of demons, trapped in a barrier until she had the ability to get out. When her spirit was broken from the torture, she became masochistic as a result. As soon as she was forced to get a life of her own, she was brainwashed once more from magic to enforce submission, making her delusional and lonely.

Before Writing the Narrative of the twins:
* Individual First, Twins Second: Ensure they are fully fleshed-out individuals with their own motivations, fears, and goals before focusing on their "twin-ness".
* Delayed Recognition: The audience doesn't have to know they are twins immediately. You can let the audience discover this slowly, perhaps through a shared appearance or a bizarrely similar life path.
* The Reunion: When they meet, it shouldn't just be happy. Consider a "frightened" reaction to seeing an identical stranger, or a clash of personalities due to their different upbringings.
* Mirrored Twins: They have opposite, mirror-image personalities.

# Bonus: Tavern Description for The Drunken Devil!

From the outside it looks horrible, uncomfortable and depressing. Clay bricks and stone pillars make up most of the building's outer structure. It's near impossible to see through the small, stained glass windows, but the awkward silence from within can be felt outside.
As you enter the tavern through the worn, metal door, you're welcomed by aromas of what's probably food, hopefully and a coldness.
The bartender is staring at nothing and makes no effort to acknowledge your pressence. It's as disgusting inside as it is on the outside. Marble pillars support the upper floor and the light fixtures attached to them. The walls are littered with all sorts of memorabilia, many of which have become unrecognizable due to dust, cobwebs and other dirt. The tavern itself is almost completely abanonded. The few people inside could be locals, could be lost souls, but whoever they are, you begin to fear for your safety, it's probably best to find a different place. You did hear rumors about this tavern, supposedly it's infamous for something, but for the life of you you can't remember what for. Though juding by the dirt and unhygienic circumstances, it's probably food poisoning.

## Features and Lore

* Sanity Stat: Affects perception of the world. The world becomes more intense the less sanity you have. When lowered, Desdemona hallucinates, becomes more of a yandere/masogire, and becomes more delusional.
* Wrath Stat: When higher, parts of a demon cannot be controlled, like in combat.
* Loyalty Stat: When higher, demons are more loyal to Desdemona.
* Scrawlings: A personal journal that gives you choices on what YOU want.
* The Tree of Forbidden Knowledge (AKA the skill tree)
* Goetiapon: A gacha mechanic to unlock goetia demons.
* Scroll Chanting: To scroll chant, simply use the read command on a scroll, which will either give you a good outcome or a bad outcome, depending on the scroll's corresponding planet and what magic it does. If you learn about the scroll by leveling up your native goetian language (a language for demons), it will appear as English.
* Planetary Hours & Days: Hours are shown from the Chaldean Clock, using the Chaldean order. Following the Chaldean order will manifest things and cause events to happen in your favor, depending on the ruled planet. For example, if you want an outcome that is aligned with the influences of a planet, you can sigilcast from a specific hour and day ruled by that planet. However, if you mismatch the planetary hours from the planetary weekdays, it will not go as expected. For instance, Planetary hours are most frequent but have less magical potency, but planetary weekdays are most potent in magic but less frequent than the planetary hours. Combine this together, and you’ll have magic that is both frequent and magically potent. The player will need to type in their intent, also known as the influences each planet naturally has (from sigilcasting).
* Sigilcasting Blood Magic: Sigilcasting is an action that requires a Dragonclaw and a Kamea Tablet. The Dragonclaw is used as a stylus to draw out sigils and to draw blood. The Kamea Tablet will be used like a digital drawing tablet, leaving no mess and instead turning the blood into a magic force.

* Spirit Hierarchy: Lesser Spawn, Common Spawn, Uncommon Spawn, Greater Spawn, President, Knight, Earl, Marquis, Duke, Prince, King
* Offerings & Sacrifices: Goetians can gain this, so can the "weaker" demons if they've earned it.
* Sins & Virtues: Influenced by actions.
* Rank: Grants privileges.
* Moral Alignment / Nature
* Great Infernal Purge: Demons roam freely at night to kill humans.
* Demon Motivation: Motivation points decrease if the bar hits zero, lessening performance and likely to leave
Wars, Battles, Arena Battles, Duels
* The Grand Creator wants to see who would best him, causing the war between Angels, Humans and Demons... For fun. Tired of his rank as a God, he told the Angels to tell everyone that the less faith they have in him, the more he will die and leave this world.
* Theurgic: A language created by Angels.
* Goetic: A language created by demons.
* The player can sleep to reset the day. Each day something different happens.

## How the Planetary Day and Hour Works

There are planetary rulers for each day and hour. The first hour (1 AM) is the same hour of the planet’s day. To structure this idea in your mind, try and imagine this: The first hour (1 AM) of Saturday is saturn, the first hour of Sunday is the sun, the first hour of Monday is the moon, the first hour of Tuesday is mars, wednesday is mercury, thursday is jupiter, and lastly friday is venus. To fill in the blanks, you must follow the chaldean order, as the hours cycle continuously:
Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon
…Then back to Saturn. Rinse and repeat. The planetary clock will look like this in-game:
Day: <day-count>
Weekday: <weekday-planet-symbol>
Hour: <hour-planet-symbol>

King - Sun - Gold (Color: Gold)
Prince - Jupiter - Tin (Color: Blue)
Duke - Venus - Copper (Color: Green)
Earl - Mars - Silver (Color: Red)
Marquis - Moon - Silver (Color: Purple)
Knight - Saturn - Lead (Color: Gray)
President - Mercury - Mercury (Color: Orange)

Sun: Health, wealth, success, joy, luck, healing, leadership, vitality, creativity, and success. Use this hour for taking action, making decisions, and pursuing impactful projects.
Moon: Psychic ability, spirituality, goddess energy, divination, emotions, intuition, reflection, and healing. Ideal for journaling, meditation, spending time with loved ones, and nurturing your inner self.
Mercury: Magic, knowledge, communication, writing, speech, communication, intellect, and learning. This hour is excellent for brainstorming, writing, planning, and engaging in intellectual pursuits.
Venus: Love, friendship, relationship, compassion, the arts, beauty, harmony, and pleasure. Use this hour for romance, artistic endeavors, self-care, and creating a beautiful atmosphere.
Mars: Strength, vitality, health, sex, anger, action, energy, passion, and courage. This is a good time for tackling challenging tasks, pursuing your passions, and initiating new projects.
Jupiter: Luck, expansion, prosperity, money, empire, abundance, and wisdom. Use this hour for making financial plans, seeking opportunities, and connecting with mentors.
Saturn: Work, stability, attention, reversals, impeding, stopping, discipline, structure, responsibility, and long-term goals. This hour is suitable for building foundations, focusing on practicality, and setting boundaries.
